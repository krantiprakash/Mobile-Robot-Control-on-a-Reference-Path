**Nonholonomic Mobile Robot Control System**

This project provides a control system for a differential-drive mobile robot to follow a predefined path accurately and smoothly. The control algorithm is designed to keep the robot stable and resilient to initial errors, noise, and environmental disturbances.

**Features:**
1.) Path Tracking: Guides the robot along a specified path with target velocity.

2.) Feedforward & Feedback Control: Combines feedforward control for path planning with feedback control to correct any deviations.

3.) Error Reduction: Minimizes position, orientation, and velocity errors to improve accuracy.
